# Core Collectors *(Name Subject to Change)*

## Description

Core Collectors is a rogue-like top-down 2D game built with LibGDX. In this game, you build turrets and defend against
waves of enemy attacks while your ship mines its way to the planet's core for valuable rewards. The game balances high
risk and high reward; if your ship gets destroyed during a mission, you lose everything. However, if you choose to leave
the planet before the difficulty spikes, you get to keep the rewards you've collected. The current version, unfortunately,
is missing most of the features mentioned.

## Current Features

- Randomly generated map.
- Spaceship
- Single and burst turrets that are operated by worker bots.
- A biter type enemy. Can form formations and attack structures.
- Game getting difficult as time passes.

## How to play
You can use the build button to open up a menu for placing turrets. Worker bots, if available, automatically find and
move towards an unoccupied turret. After placing the turrets around the spaceship, click the start button to start the
miner and start the waves.
