# Core Collectors *(Name Subject to Change)*

## Description

Core Collectors is a rogue-like top-down 2D game built with LibGDX. In this game, you build turrets and defend against
waves of enemy attacks while your ship mines its way to the planet's core for valuable rewards. The game balances high
risk and high reward; if your ship gets destroyed during a mission, you lose everything. However, if you choose to leave
the planet before the difficulty spikes, you get to keep the rewards you've collected.

## Planned Features

- **Rogue-like Mechanics**: Permadeath and high-risk, high-reward gameplay.
- **Turret Building**: Strategically place turrets to defend against enemy waves.
- **Procedural Generation**
- **Resource Mining**: Mine your way to the planet's core to gather valuable resources.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Balance between staying for greater rewards and escaping before the difficulty becomes
  overwhelming.

## Installation
The game is still in development so no releases yet. You can clone the repository. Also, I am planning to work on 
the android version, one day hopefully.

**Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/core-collectors.git
    ```
